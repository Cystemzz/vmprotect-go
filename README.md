# vmprotect-go

Got bored so I made this in a couple minutes. I don't own VMProtect Ultimate so only part of the SDK has been ported. If someone would like to do the rest of the sdk then a pull request is welcome. Also if you get an error that VMProtectSDK.dll is missing then copy the dll from your VMProtect installation folder (usually C:\Program Files\VMProtect <version>\Lib\Windows) to the same folder as your compiled binary.
